# NFT-Enhancement Project

NFT-Enhancement Project! I've extended the functionality of the existing NFT contract by introducing a novel feature known as `borrowAuthNFT`. This innovative function allows external entities to access the metadata associated with my NFTs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before embarking on this project:

## Project Kick-off

Initiate your journey with the NFT-Enhancement Project by following these steps:

1. Open the [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/) and create dedicated files for Contracts, Transactions, and Scripts.

2. Implement the `CreateCollection` transaction to establish your distinctive NFT collection.

3. Execute the `MintNFT` transaction to create a brand new NFT within your collection.

4. Run the `GetID` script to retrieve the unique NFT ID required for subsequent operations in the main script.

5. Employ the `MetaData` script to access and extract valuable information from the NFTs you've successfully created.
